aiocoap -- The Python CoAP library
==================================

The aiocoap package is a Python implementation of CoAP, the Constrained
Application Protocl (`RFC 7252`_, more info as http://coap.technology/).

It uses the asyncio module introduced in Python 3.4 to facilitate concurrent
operations while maintaining a simple to use interface and not depending on
anything outside the standard library.

aiocoap is originally based on txThings_. If you want to use CoAP in your
existing twisted application, or can not migrate to Python 3 yet, that is
probably more useful to you than aiocoap.
