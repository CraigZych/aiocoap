"""Basic resource implementations

A resource in URL / CoAP / REST terminology is the thing identified by a URI.

Here, a :class:`.Resource` is the place where server functionality is
implemented. In many cases, there exists one persistent Resource object for a
given resource (eg. a ``TimeResource()`` is responsible for serving the
``/time`` location). On the other hand, an aiocoap server context accepts only
one thing as its serversite, and that is a Resource too (typically of the
:class:`Site` class).

Resources are most easily implemented by deriving from :class:`.Resource` and
implementing ``render_GET``, ``render_POST`` and similar coroutine methods.
Those take a single request message object and must return a
:class:`aiocoap.Message` object.

To serve more than one resource on a site, use the :class:`Site` class to
dispatch requests based on the Uri-Path header.
